# Filtering ISBNs from File

## What have we learned so far

1. Non-primitive types need to be passed by reference and const when appropriate
2. Be aware of the order of operations x - a - b != x - (a - b)
3. How to debug on CLion
   4. Breakpoints
   5. Watches (to see the current value of a variable)
6. How to deal with characters if we want the number, so to change '1' to 1 we just subtract 48
7. Namespaces are like packages in Java, they create scopes
8. Method at of class string (string::at)
   9. str.at(3) -- str[3]   ==> at is safer
10.
